""" Rule for frozen orbital numbers.

This option will be generate and be overrided by option ``frozen_list``.

Parameters
----------
PySCF
    Rule from ``pyscf.data.elements.chemcore_atm``.
FreezeNobleGasCore
    Freeze largest noble gas core, which is default of G16 for non-6-31G-basis.
FreezeInnerNobleGasCore
    Freeze orbitals that next to largest noble gas core.
SmallCore
    Small frozen core from [1]_.
LargeCore
    Large frozen core from [1]_. This may also be the same to FreezeG2 in G16.

Warnings
--------
TODO: Function to parse frozen rule.

Parameters
----------
True
    Store tensor in memory.
False
    Store tensor in disk.
None
    Do not store tensor in either disk or memory.
"auto"
    Leave program to judge whether tensor locates.

Parameters
----------
"RI", "RI-JK"
